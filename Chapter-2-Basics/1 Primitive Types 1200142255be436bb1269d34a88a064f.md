# 1. Primitive Types

# Arithmetic Types — characters, integers, boolean values, and floating-point numbers.

### **1.Bool —→ 1 byte —> range(true, false)**

**signed char —> 1 byte —> range(-128 to 127)( -2ˆ7 — 2ˆ7-1 )**

左闭右减

**unsigned char —> 1 byte —> range(0 to 2ˆ8 -1 == 255)**

### **2. short —> 2 bytes —> range(-2 ^15 to 2ˆ15-1)**

**unsigned short —> 2 bytes —> range (0 to 2 ^15 - 1)**

### **3.int —> 4 bytes —> range (-2ˆ31 to 2^31 -1)**

**unsigned int —> 4 bytes —> range (0 to 2ˆ32 -1)**

singed int/ int → 4 bytes → range(2^31 - 1)

**long int —> 4/8 bytes —>** 

**long unsigned int —> 4/8 bytes**

**long long int —>  8 bytes —> range(-2 ˆ63 to 2 ^63 -1)**

**long long unsigned int —> 8 bytes —> range(0 to 2^64 -1 )**

**Float and Double date both data types that used to represent floating-point number, but they differ in their precision, size, and range.**

**Float:**

- The size of float is typically 4 bytes(32 bits).
- The precision of float type approximately 6-7 decimal digits,

**Double:**

- The size of double is typically 8 bytes(64 bits)
- The precision of double type approximately 15-16 decimal digits.

**example 1**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main(){
    bool chart = true;
    signed char anime = 'a';
    unsigned char habord = 'c';
    
    std::cout<< chart << " " << anime << " " << habord << std::endl;
  
}
1 a c
```

**example 2**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main(){ 
    int number1 = (int)pow(2,32); // -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
    std::cout<< number1 << std::endl;
}
```

The range of a 4bytes signed integer is typically from -2ˆ31 to 2ˆ31-1, this may result in overflow. the actual outcome may depend on the compiler and platform.

some compiler may wrap around the value, others might produce an error , and in some cases, you might get unexpected results.

**example 3**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main(){ 
    
    int number1 = 560;
    unsigned int num2 = 545u;
    
    long int num3 = 45454L;
    unsigned long int num4 = 4343444ul;
    
    long long int num5 = 45ll;
    
    long long unsigned int num6 = 23ull;
    
    std::cout<< number1 << " "<< num2 << " "<< num3 << " "<< num4 << std::endl;
    std::cout<< num5 << " "<< num6 << std::endl;
}
>>>560 545 45454 4343444
45 23
```

### Four int*_t overloads

int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

int main() {
    int8_t a = 42;
    int16_t b = 32767;
    int32_t c = -2147483648;

    std::cout << "int8_t: " << a << std::endl;
    std::cout << "int16_t: " << b << std::endl;
    std::cout << "int32_t: " << c << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
>>>int8_t: *
int16_t: 32767
int32_t: -2147483648
```

I/O stream interprets uint8_t and int8_t as char and not as integer.

When to use signed integer type?

1. handling negative values
2. In most cases, if you don’t have reason to use unsigned integers, the default choice is to use signed integers.
3. arithmetic operations

When to use unsigned integer type?

1. avoiding negative values
2. bitwise operations and bit flags: 

Practice:

To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use
for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

Rate:

- Type: double or float is typically used to represent a mortgage interest rate such as 3.5%.
- Reason: the mortgage rate is not like a whole number, they often contain decimals that need to be accurately represented like 7.44%.
- using the double or float allows you to capture fractional pecentages with percision, which is essential for mortgage calculation. especially over long period where small changes in the rate can have significant impact.

**Principal**: `Double` (or `Long` or `BigDecimal`)

- **Type**: `Double`, `Long`, or `BigDecimal` depending on the size and precision of the loan.
- reason: The principle amount is usually a large number that includes the cents, double or big decimal ensures you can manange the full value of the loan with high accuracy. percision matters because rounding errors in large values can significantly affect long-term calculation.

### **Payment**: `Double` (or `BigDecimal`)

- **Type**: `Double` or `BigDecimal` to represent the regular mortgage payment.
- **Reason**: Mortgage payments often involve decimal values, as the monthly payment includes interest calculated on the principal. You want the flexibility to accurately represent values with decimals. If you need **extreme precision** (like for accounting purposes), `BigDecimal` can be used to avoid rounding issues, especially when payments are calculated over long periods.
