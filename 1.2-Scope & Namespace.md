# 2.Scope & Namespace

**The << Operator takes two operands: the left-hand operand must be an ostream object;** 

**the right-hand operand is a value to print** 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std :: cout << "this is a line" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

The result of left operator becomes the left-hand operand of the second.

This program uses std::cout and std::endl rather than just cout and endl.

The prefex std:: indicates that the name cout and endl are defined inside the namespace named std. Namespace allows us to avoid inadvertent collision between the names we define and uses of those same names inside a library.

## What is namespace in programming.

in this scenario, you have two start method in your program, on start method is under the web folder, and another start method is under player folder. 

this two start methods are contained in their own namespace.

namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions.

A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers(types, functions, variables) inside it.

All identifiers at namespace scope are visible to one another without qualification. identifiers outside the namespace can access the members by using the fully qualified name for each identifier.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

namespace ContoData{
    class ObjectManager{
        public:
            void DoSomething(){
                std::cout << "do something in contodata namespace" << std::endl;
            }
            void PrintInfo(){
                std::cout << "obejctManager object at address: " << this << std::endl;
            }
    };
    void Func(ObjectManager objM){
        objM.PrintInfo();
    }
    void ExtraFunc(ObjectManager objM){
        objM.PrintInfo();
    }
}

int main(){
    std::cout<< "hello world" << std::endl;
    
    ContoData::ObjectManager mgr;
    
    mgr.DoSomething();
    
    mgr.PrintInfo();
    
    ContoData::Func(mgr); 
    
    ContoData::ExtraFunc(mgr); 
    
}
>>>hello world
do something in contodata namespace
obejctManager object at address: 0x7ffe52d579ff
obejctManager object at address: 0x7ffe52d579df
obejctManager object at address: 0x7ffe52d579df
```

why in mgr.PrintInfo() and ContoData::Func(mgr) have different mgr address, 

and Func(mgr), ExtraFunc(mgr) have the same mgr address.

1. in the main() function, the ObjectManager object named mgr is created
2. when ContoData::Func(mgr) is called, a copy of the mgr object is created and passed to the Func() function. 
3. ExtraFUNC() received the same copy of the mgr object.
